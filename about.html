      <h1>Hi. I am Maryam Akhundova. I study Information Technologies at ADA University.</h1>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I won't lie and tell the truth. I didn't start coding the second I was born and didn't know much about technologies. My parents bought and installed router only when I was 11 years old (just because COVID-19 started and education moved to online).</p>
        <p>I didn't even start coding when I was 12 or older. I am starting my coding journey now and this is my first project. Children younger than me know more about coding than I do. So, as they say "Better late than never", right?</p>
        <p>I made a huge mistake by not preparing properly for midterm exam and I will do my best to compensate it. I hope you will enjoy this project. Merry Christmas and Good Luck in future life!</p>
        <p>If You want to make projects together, I would love to <a class="accent" href="{{ '/' | relative_url }}#contact">reach out</a>.</p>
